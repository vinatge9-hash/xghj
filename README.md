# The Daily Grind â€” Website Build

This project provides a complete 5-page (plus README) static website for a cozy, modern coffee shop named The Daily Grind.

Phase: Discovery -> Build

Pages:
- index.html: Home with hero, featured drinks, and testimonials
- about.html: Our Story with founders image
- contact.html: Visit page with address, hours, and contact form
- cart.html: Fully client-side functional cart (localStorage) with ability to review items
- checkout.html: Checkout flow with delivery details and order summary
- README.md: This documentation

Technical notes:
- All styling is done with Tailwind CSS classes loaded via CDN. Fonts are designated via Tailwind config (Lora for headings, Inter for body).
- Images use the required placeholder syntax: src='https://images.pexels.com/photos/8293777/pexels-photo-8293777.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940'
- Accessibility: semantic HTML5 elements, semantic headings, descriptive alt attributes.
- Animations: on-load fade-in and viewport-based section reveal implemented with simple JS and Tailwind utility classes.
- Currency uses a simple client-side calculation; no server calls are required for this demo.
- The current date/context (Saturday, September 6, 2025, Nadargul, Telangana, India) is reflected in pages when applicable.

Usage:
- Open index.html in a modern browser. Use the navigation or the CTA buttons to explore.
- The Cart and Checkout are client-side simulations suitable for demonstration purposes. You can add items to the cart from the Home page and view them in the Cart page, then proceed to Checkout.
